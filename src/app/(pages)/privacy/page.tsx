                    This website is an educational project created for demonstration purposes. It includes user

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Only open data provided by Google and GitHub OAuth is used â€” no additional personal information
                        is requested or stored.

                        the duration of the demonstration.
                    </li>
                    <li>Data is not sold, rented, or shared with third parties.</li>

                    <li>
